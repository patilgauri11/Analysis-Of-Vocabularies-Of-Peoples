# Analysis-Of-Vocabularies-Of-Peoples
This project is basically the analysis of the vocabularies of people based on their medium of schooling , their reading habits and the various newspapers they read. We conducted three tests for every individual namely verbal speed, how fast you are and verbal responsiveness. Basically the first test checked the verbal speed of an individual in determining if 2 adjacent words are either same, opposite or different. They had to solve this test in 3 minutes for 30 words. 
The 2nd test comprised of jotting down words beginning from ‘D’ within 3 minutes except nouns and tenses of a single word. 
The third test was to write synonyms or approximately same meaning word of the given word mandatorily starting with alphabet ‘P’. This one had no time limit. We collected about 150 samples in our college ageing from 17-24 years.
